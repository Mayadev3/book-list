# Book-List üìö

This book-list app was built with focus on Object Oriented Programming in ES5 and ES6. Book lovers can use this app to keep track of all the books they have in their library. 
Adults, children, and librarians can add all the books they have read and sort them by title, author, and isbn. Each time a book is added, removed, or the input 
fields are empty, an alert will pop up that has a setTimeout of 3000 ms. All books are persisted to local storage and can be seen on screen even after the application has been closed. üßê
